TODO
 - Implement the compareTo() method of the Comparable interface to compare two shapes by
   their height, and the compare() method of the Comparator interface to compare two shapes
   by their base area and their volume.
 - testing application will then invoke the utility methods to re-arrange the figures according to the
   compare type from the largest to smallest (descending order).
 - The testing program should print the time it took to sort the collection of objects for each sorting
  algorithm. It should also print the first and last value and every thousandth value in between.
 - Implement the sorting algorithms as part of a utility class. It must sort a collection of Comparables.
   Make sure it is not dependent on the testing application and that it can be re-used in the future. (Your
   sorting methods should be invoked like the Arrays.sort() method.)
 - File name F, the compare type and the sort type are provided as parameters (-f –t –s or -F –T –S) via
   command line. The program must be order and case insensitive. For example, all examples below are
   valid inputs:
   java -jar sort.jar –fpolyfor1.txt –Tv –Sb
   java -jar sort.jar –ta –sQ –fpolyfor3.txt
   java -jar sort.jar –tH –Fpolyfor5.txt –sB
   where v is volume, h is height, a is base area, b is bubble, s is selection, i is insertion, m is merge, q
   is quick, and your choice of sorting algorithm is z.

   is quick, and your choice of sorting algorithm is z.


 Notes

 	- Comparable
 		○ For objects that have a natural order
 		○ CompareTo() = captures the notion of less or greater than for objects
 			§ Returns an integer related to result / negative or 0 for equal or positive
 	- Comparator
 		○ For objects that can have multiple comparison attributes
 		○ You have no control over
 		○ Needs to implement strategy design pattern
 		○ Compare() = comparison of objects (based on your inputs)
 			§ Returns an integer related to result / negative or 0 for equal or positive
